# dynamodb

We are aware that not all information will be readily and easily accessible for every API call. So, some information should be mirrored in a database such as DynamoDB. This folder will contain documentation on how the DynamoDB tables are set up.

Here, we will define the methods by which each value in each table will be updated. What will be updated by lambda functions? What is the Nodejs script responsible for updating?


Example table document:
table: UserAccess
ID: ASCII (autogenerated?)
Value:
```JSON
{
  "useraccessID":"ASCII",
  "autostackID":  "ASCII",
  "playerID": "ASCII",
  "accesstype": "enter|exit",
  "datetime": "2015-10-26T07:46:36.611Z"
}
```
